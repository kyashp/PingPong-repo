# Ping Pong Ball game

## Introduction
Learnt how to download and use SDL2 with C++ to make a two-player game.

## Controls
Player 1, Red Paddle uses Keys W (to move up) and S (to move down).
Player 2, Blue Paddle uses Keys Up and Down for the same controls respectively.

## Additional
When any player loses, ball position is reset to the center of the screen. Downloading SDL2 was a pain, the dll files required to render png images had to be downloaded separately. 
This game apart from the downloading taught me how to use pointers and passsing by reference better and the basic methods like handleEvents(), update() and render() to make another game.
In future game projects I intend to explore the physics of objects and their movements.
